# zhang_mouse_aging
This repository is for creating a [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/) track for the Zhang Lab. The repository is organized so that scripts are in directories named for what they do and numbered for the order in which they can be run (some can be run at the same stage), and the resulting track files are in the `track_hub` directory. The files in the `track_hub` directory will be used to create the browser tracks. <br/>
There is a log file that shows the code I ran to create the tracks.
